                <h4>1. Prepare the cashews</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Place the cashews in a bowl and cover with hot water. Let them soak for at least 30 minutes. This will soften them and make them easier to blend.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the red lentil fusilli and cook according to the package instructions, typically around 7-9 minutes, until al dente.</li>
                    <li>Drain the pasta and set aside.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                <h4>3. Make the Sauce</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>While the pasta is cooking, drain the soaked cashews and add them to a blender or food processor.</li>
                    <li>Add the roughly chopped garlic clove, roasted red pepper, sundried tomatoes, and basil leaves to the blender.</li>
                    <li>Blend until smooth, adding a small amount of water if needed to achieve a creamy consistency. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.</li>

                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked pasta with the cashew and roasted red pepper sauce. Toss well to ensure the pasta is evenly coated with the sauce.</li>
                </ul>
