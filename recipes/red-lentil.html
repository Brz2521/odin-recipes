            <h3>Making the sauce</h3>
            <ul>
                <h4>1. Prepare the cashews</h4>
                <li class="steps">Place the cashews in a bowl and cover with hot water. Let them soak for at least 30 minutes. This will soften them and make them easier to blend.</li>

                <h4>2. Cook the Pasta</h4>
                <li class="steps">Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the red lentil fusilli and cook according to the package instructions, typically around 7-9 minutes, until al dente.</li>
                <li class="steps">Drain the pasta and set aside.</li>

                <h4>3. Make the Sauce</h4>
                <li class="steps">While the pasta is cooking, drain the soaked cashews and add them to a blender or food processor.</li>
                <li class="steps">Add the roughly chopped garlic clove, roasted red pepper, sundried tomatoes, and basil leaves to the blender.</li>
                <li class="steps">Blend until smooth, adding a small amount of water if needed to achieve a creamy consistency. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.</li>

                <h4>4. Combine Pasta and Sauce</h4>
                <li class="steps">In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked pasta with the cashew and roasted red pepper sauce. Toss well to ensure the pasta is evenly coated with the sauce.</li>

                <h4>5. Serve and Enjoy</h4>
                <li class="steps">Serve immediately and enjoy your healthy and delicious red lentil pasta dish!</li>
